# TFT_Analyzer
Product TFT Analyzer is an Android app that can analyze user's previous matches and figure out which deck that made user win the most, 
and which items were most useful for that deck. Not only that, which deck counters user's favorite deck. Furthermore, I am planning to 
develop an feature that suggesting other decks that are similar to user's favorite deck.
